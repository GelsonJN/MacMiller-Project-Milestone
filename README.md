#MacMiller Milestone Project

For my first Milestone Project I will be showcasing my first self made project and will be a website about musician/artist Mac Miller.

## UX
 
This website will mainly be targeted to teens as Mac Miller was well known by his young-style-like music however there's a possibility of expansation on the range of target audience as this is also targeted to new fans, or people who haven't known of him.
The layout is simple with no major complex pages. As it is about knowing more about a character involved with music, only 3 pages were made (with several external links) these being 'Home', 'Biography' and 'Media' all surrounded with the character's professional activities (songs and music videos in this case) to really get a clear understandidng on who Mac Miller was.


## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Special Features
- Iframes - allows users to quickly, without having to leave website, access external websites.

## Testing
I conducted a few tests all over the website and was able to find mistakes that were after corrected and re-tested. I was able to test every external link, image size according to its screen size and a few more. 
I found an issue that wasn't able to correct which was in the 'Biography' page, when viewed in a smaller screen, the paragraph tends to go off screen and enlarge the screen. I tried to look for my mistakes within my CSS but I wasn't able to find anything that would correct these issue occuring on different size screens outside a normal computer screen.
